One of my biggest peeves about my website was the time taken to load the display font — the titles would initially render in <span style="font-family: Georgia;">Georgia</span> and after a few seconds there would be a layout shift when my chosen font, Tiempos Headline, finally loaded! I read an excellent article by Zach Leatherman, [Developing a Robust Font Loading Strategy for CSS-Tricks](https://www.zachleat.com/web/css-tricks-web-fonts/), which inspired me to change my font loading strategy and massively reduce initial load times.\n\n## Before Optimising the Fonts\n\nBefore I decided to optimise the fonts on my website, I was loading four web fonts on the home page and up to **seven** web fonts on some other pages! These amounted to a staggering **145kB**:\n\n* Tiempos Headline, 31.3kB\n* Tiempos Headline Bold, 30.2kB\n* IBM Plex Sans, 17.9kB\n* IBM Plex Sans Bold, 18.7kB\n* IBM Plex Sans Italic, 19.5kB\n* IBM Plex Mono, 13.7kB\n* IBM Plex Mono Bold, 14.1kB\n\nOpening up the Network panel in Chrome DevTools showed the time taken to download all four web fonts on the home page. The waterfall graph below shows the times at which the fonts were requested, over a period of 600ms:\n\n![A waterfall graph showing the four fonts taking just under 600ms to load](/assets/images/dynamic/optimising-fonts/waterfall1.png)\n\nThe first request for the body font (IBM Plex Sans) started at around 140ms and finished before 200ms, which isn\'t too bad! However, the other fonts took a further 200–300ms to download, which resulted in a nasty layout shift, as you can see here:\n\n<video src="/blog/optimising-the-fonts-on-my-website/loading1.webm" type="video/webm" autoplay muted loop></video>\n\n## Font Loading Strategies\n\nBefore we go any further, it\'s about time we talked about some different font loading strategies.
